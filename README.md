# AI in Healthcare
This project focuses on developing a custom-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model capable of identifying various skin diseases through image analysis. The model has been trained on medical images to recognize specific patterns and features associated with different skin conditions, enabling it to provide potential diagnoses with reliable accuracy. This work lays the foundation for future integration into AI-powered healthcare solutions aimed at improving early detection and raising awareness about skin-related health issues.
