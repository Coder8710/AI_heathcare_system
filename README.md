# AI_heathcare_system
This project focuses on developing a web-based platform that uses artificial intelligence to identify 
skin diseases through image analysis while incorporating an interactive chatbot for health-related 
inquiries. By using machine learning algorithms, the system analyzes uploaded images to provide 
potential diagnoses, aiding users in understanding their condition. Additionally, the chatbot offers 
fundamental health insights, guiding users towards professional medical consultations when 
necessary. The objective is to enhance healthcare accessibility and promote early intervention for 
skin-related concerns. 

For the AI chatbot, we will use an API for its integration into the system. The final platform 
will be put together using the most basic web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and 
JavaScript for the front end, and backend will be set up using frameworks like Flask or 
Django.

Convolutional neural network (CNN) model which is capable of accurately identifying image is trained to recognize and 
predict various skin conditions accurately.

* Here is the dataset description in points:
   The dataset contains images of skin diseases, with corresponding class labels.

   The class labels and their corresponding skin diseases are as follows:

    1. nv: Melanocytic nevi (6,705 images)
    2. mel: Melanoma (1,111 images)
    3. bkl: Benign keratosis-like lesions (1,095 images)
    4. bcc: Basal cell carcinoma (514 images)
    5. akiec: Actinic keratosis (327 images)
    6. vasc: Vascular lesions (142 images)
    7. df: Dermatofibroma (115 images)
